  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements (REQ-49 through REQ-53) with strong coverage. useAppState.ts has the correct Screen union, initialState, and go() function. App.tsx has the exact 'explorer' case. ExplorerScreen.tsx has the PROS_DEMO array with all 6 entries and the required layout. FicheProScreen.tsx has the null guard. A few minor items in REQ-51 are uncertain due to truncation but appear largely implemented.",

      "id": "REQ-51",
      "requirement": "TabBarClient must be in natural flex flow, never position:fixed, with flexShrink:0",
      "reason": "The ExplorerScreen.tsx diff is truncated and does not show the TabBarClient rendering section. Cannot confirm it is rendered in natural flex flow with flexShrink:0 and not position:fixed.",

      "reason": "The build request lists adding new screens as a non-goal and the fix scope only covers ExplorerScreen, FicheProScreen, App.tsx, and useAppState.ts. The diff shows four fully implemented booking screens beyond the stated fix scope.",
